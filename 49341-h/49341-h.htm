<p>The Seattle Car &amp; Foundry Company was started
in 1905 by a few Seattle business men who had
faith in the ability of the Pacific Coast to support
a home industry of this nature. A steady growth
both in scope and quantity of business has confirmed
their judgment. Today the Seattle Car &amp; Foundry
Company not only competes on an equal footing with
the east for the trade of the Pacific, but has extended
its field successfully into Alaska, British Columbia,
China and all other sections of the Orient. In its
commodious, modern and efficient plant it designs and
builds Flat Cars, Box Cars, Logging Cars, Logging
Trucks, Air-Equipped Connected Trucks, Logging
Bunks and Chocks, Gondola Cars, Refrigerator Cars,
Plantation Cars and Cane Cars, Caboose Cars, Camp
Cars, Industrial Cars, Contractors Dump Cars, Push
Cars, Quarry Cars, Track Construction Cars, Tram Cars.</p>

<h2><a href="images/fig_003.jpg">The Leading Car Shops of the Pacific Coast</a></h2>

<p>At the present time the works of the Seattle Car &amp; Foundry Co. constitutes the largest
and best equipped plant on the Pacific Coast for the manufacture of cars, trucks and
contractor's equipment, with which is affiliated a rolling mill, providing us ample material
under most favorable conditions.</p>

<p>While the shops are perhaps not so extensive as those of some of our Eastern and
European competitors, they are capable of turning out work in sufficient quantities and of
a quality to enable us to successfully bid on orders of any proportions.</p>

<p>We have been able to satisfy the most rigid requirements of such trans-continental railroads
as the Northern Pacific, Southern Pacific, Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul, and the
Harriman system, such electric companies as Stone &amp; Webster, the British Columbia Electric
Railway and the Portland Light &amp; Power Company, not to mention successful competition
in the Orient with the leading firms of Europe.</p>

<p>But in spite of this success we never lose sight of the fact that this plant was started
primarily for the better service of the Pacific Coast&mdash;particularly of the Pacific Coast logging
trade. In this field we claim a special fitness which has been proven, by the growth of
our business, in a few years, from a very humble beginning into an organization of considerable
industrial significance.</p>

<p>But whether you buy cars, trucks, forgings, castings, contractors, bridge building or
mining equipment, we are in a position to give you better delivery than the East, greater
capacity than any other coast shops of the same character, and prices that are most reasonable
for the service rendered. Our sales and engineering department are at your disposal.</p>

<p>You will get satisfaction in dealing with us. Three quarters of our new business
this year was from old customers. Why not get acquainted with them and us? Write
them or us.</p>

<h3>Details of Air-Equipped Connected Truck<br />

(CAPACITY 80,000 POUNDS, ALLOWABLE OVERLOAD 10%)</h3>

<p>This car was designed with the object of providing heavy capacity Trucks with Air-Brakes, and at the
same time reducing the dead weight and maintenance to a minimum. This has become a recognized
Standard Logging Car, and as the design permits of considerable latitude in length of car and centers of
bunks, we do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who requires either Flat Cars or Trucks for strictly
logging purposes. The convenience of operation as compared with other types of equipment is apparent.
From an economic standpoint the comparison is even greater. Some of the advantages are given below in
detail:</p>

<p>1st. SIMPLICITY. Few parts to get out of repair, consequently car is always in commission.</p>

<p>2nd. REDUCED COST. First cost is 18% less than Flat Car of same capacity and equipment.</p>

<p>3rd. SMALL COST OF MAINTENANCE. More than 50% less than Flat Car.</p>

<p>4th. SAFETY OF OPERATION. Greatly increased over detached Trucks on account of Air Equipment
and rigidity of connection, and over Flat Car in loading and unloading on account of skeleton construction.</p>

<p>5th. REFUSE NOT CARRIED TO DUMP. No deck to accumulate rubbish, adding to dead weight of
car, and carrying it to the dump where it is discharged, often necessitating dredging to secure necessary depth
of water.</p>

<p>6th. REDUCED DEAD HAUL. Which is 30% less than Flat Car of same capacity and equipment. This
is important where heavy grades are encountered.</p>

<p>7th. OPEN DESIGN. Facilitates operation of both loading and unloading, lessening the time required
and reducing the danger. At the same time, ample protection is provided for Brake Rigging, eliminating
danger of being fouled by falling logs.</p>

<p>8th. INCREASED BUFFING CAPACITY. Connecting timbers forming backbone of 300 sq. in. cross
section, which offers great resistance to buffing shocks.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Length over timber, 40 feet, can be furnished up to 56 feet. Length over all, 42 feet. Width
over connecting timbers, 30 inches. Height to center of Coupler, 2 feet, 10 inches. Height
to top of Bunk, 48 inches. Width of Bunk, optional, 9 feet or 10 feet. Bunk centers in
illustration, 24 feet, but is optional with purchaser. M. C. B. Automatic Couplers. Westinghouse
Air Brakes. Inside Hung Metal Brake Beams. Standard Diamond Arch Bar Truck
Frame. Metal Truck Bolster. Seattle Car Manufacturing Co.'s Patent Cast Steel Body Bolster
in combination with Patent Cast Steel Bunks, riveted together, making solid section. Thirty-three
inch Cast Iron Wheels, chilled tread, double plate. Steel Axles, 4&frac12; &times; 8 inch Journals.
Malleable Iron and Steel Castings used throughout. Draft Gear optional. (Twin Spring or
tandem.) Bunks Cast Steel, Hercules Patent, equipped with Knight Patent Chock, the McLafferty
Stake, or the Skookum Bunk. Weight, approximately 19,000 pounds. This Car is
protected by U. S. Patents.</p></div>

<h3>Air-Equipped Connected Truck</h3>

<p>The Most Practical Skeleton Logging Car on the Market. Equipped With U. S. Safety
Appliances to Meet Interstate Commerce Commission Requirements.</p>

<p>This car has done more to make the name of the Seattle Car &amp; Foundry Co. well known among the logging
fraternity than any other single one of our products. We instituted their use on the Pacific Coast. They
were designed to avoid many of the obvious disadvantages of flat cars and to add the element of safety to
trucks without materially increasing cost.</p>

<p>The letter which follows, pictures better than we could, the reception and experience of the trade, from
the view point of the actual operator.</p>

Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Horton our Secretary has requested me to write you of
our experience with the connected logging trucks which we have
been using for the last three or four years.</p>

<p>In a general way I might classify this under two heads, construction
and operation. Regards to construction of these cars
will say, while they are seemingly light, we have found them
very strong, and more serviceable in our logging than flat cars
which we had previously used and are still using. The air equipment
as arranged in these cars is very well protected, and we
have experienced practically no trouble whatsoever from breakage.
Due to the construction of these cars with their three sills
as the only woodwork, we have found the cost of maintenance
very little, perhaps due to a certain extent to the accessibility of
the parts, which permit of a thorough inspection by simply
walking past the car. In operating, we have found these cars
exceptionally adapted to the hauling of logs, and during our four
years experience do not recall an instance where the load has
been spilled due to any fault of the bunk or blocks. Our cars, of
which we have twenty-four in operation, are built on twenty-four
foot truck centers with nine and ten foot bunks, and during the
last year and a half we have lost but one log except through derailment.
We find that these cars seemingly ride easier than the
seven flat cars which we have in service, permit of a larger load
and carry their loads to better advantage. These cars are easily
loaded, and it is not uncommon that we haul nine and ten thousand
feet to the car. Our loads will average between seven and
eight thousand feet per car. All of the trainmen who have
worked on these cars, and the loaders in the woods like them
very much. The fact that they are easy to load leads the loaders
to put on a good load on them and in a careful manner, and in an
all around way will consider them very much superior to the flat
cars we are using, being seven in number of the standard logging
type.</p>

Dear Sir<br />
</p>

<p>Your Hercules logging trucks are the best car
for heavy logging that I have seen and we are now buying no
other. My experience dates back twenty-five years and I am
familiar with the old N.P. trucks and G.N. trucks which when
put out in '93 were the best trucks made, and also the trucks
manufactured in Tacoma, Seattle and by ourselves. We have
had them all more or less in our trains for the last ten years
and have opportunities to observe them under all classes of
service. We have had less repairs and less trouble on account
of hot boxes with your cars than any others. Our cars are all
equipped with the Knight chock block which we find very effective
and safe.</p>

<p>The Skookum Chief, One-Piece Cast Steel Truck Frame is a radical departure from the old and well
known designs and is a distinct step forward. The cast steel frame in locomotive tender construction and
passenger car trucks has been widely used and is in favor. The use of cast steel has many advantages. The
most economic distribution of metal is made possible, and greatest strength with least weight is the result.
In a built-up frame there is always some weak point which is usually where the parts are bolted together.
Bolts become loose and nuts are lost. A comparison of the Skookum Chief with any other truck cannot fail
to show clearly its advantages in this respect. The Side Frame, End Frame, Draft Beams and Bolster being
in ONE PIECE eliminates possibility of weakness where these parts are usually joined by bolts, and the
sections of the various parts are so well proportioned that nothing short of a serious wreck could cause failure.
The repairman would be almost unnecessary and the Truck would
always be in commission, making it possible to handle the business of a
camp with one or two sets of trucks less.</p>

<p>This illustrates our 80,000-pound capacity Snohomish Truck, with all Metal Frame and
Bolster, but with Fir Draft Timbers. This truck is designed to couple with standard equipment,
with a height of 2 feet, 10 inches to center of coupler and 4 feet, 0 inches to top of
bunk. The Bolster is built up of two heavy Steel Channels reinforced with steel cover
plates top and bottom securely riveted to channels. The Truck is equipped with Hercules
Bunk and Knight Chock and is also fitted with Metal Bunk
Brace.</p>

<p>The same general remarks apply to this truck as to
Snohomish Truck No. 123. The frame is of heavy iron bars
and the fir draft timbers have a sectional area of 144 square
inches, which offers great resistance to buffing shocks.</p>

<h2>"Snohomish" Logging Truck</h2>


<p>This truck is especially adapted to use on Logging Railroads, where an uneven track
demands a flexible running gear and an extremely strong frame. These requirements are
carried out in this design by placing the springs over the Journal Boxes and making the
frame of extra heavy Iron Bars. The simplicity of the design also appeals to the operators,
making it necessary to carry but few extra parts for repairs.</p>

<h2><a name="Rainier_Logging_Truck" id="Rainier_Logging_Truck">"Rainier" Logging Truck</a></h2>


<p>We are the first builders of Logging Equipment to depart from the practice of the last twenty years
and produce a Logging Truck designed along practical and economic lines. Modern railroading has developed
the "Cast Steel" Engine Frame, Tender Frame and Passenger Truck Frame. Wherever safety is required
together with lightness and durability, Cast Steel has been introduced.</p>

<p>Following this modern plan we have constructed the "Rainier" All Cast Steel Truck of eight pieces
where ordinarily several hundred are used.</p>

<p>Each Side Frame is in one piece taking the place of Top Arch Bar, Inverted Arch Bar, Tie Bar, Heel
Brace, Truck Columns, and the many Bolts used to hold these parts together.</p>

<p>Each End Frame is in one piece taking the place of Top End Bar, Bottom End Bar, Striking Plate,
Carry Iron, Corner Gussets, Brake Staff Brackets, and the numerous Bolts necessary to tie these parts together.</p>

<p>The Draft Beams are each in one piece, taking the place of Draft Timber, Draft Lugs, and the Bolts required
to anchor them.</p>

<p>The use of Cast Steel permits of the most economic distribution of the metal, and the "Rainier" Truck
is an example of what can be accomplished.</p>

<p>The Bolster and Bunk are similar to those used in the Hercules Trucks.</p>

<p>Springs are located under the Bolster to absorb shocks which would otherwise be transferred directly
to the Truck Frame. The Springs over the Journal Boxes provide additional protection from shocks and also
permit the wheels to hold the rails on an uneven track or at low joints.</p>

<p>Brake Beams are hung between the wheels and kept high enough to protect them in case of derailment.</p>

<p>The equipment includes Automatic Couplers to Couple with Standard Equipment, 33 inches above rail,
and 33 inch Chilled Cast Iron Wheels fitted on Steel Axles with 5 &times; 9 inch Journals.</p>

<p>Journal Boxes are Malleable Iron. No Cast Iron is used with the exception of Brake Shoes.</p>

<p>The Center Bearing of the Bunk and Bolster is so constructed that the Bunk cannot turn over under
load when train is started or stopped suddenly, as the Bunk cannot be removed from the Truck until it is
turned parallel to the Draft Beams. The "Rainier" Truck stands for safety first.</p>

<p>This truck is similar to the one shown on the preceding page. It differs only in
having the side frames cast in one piece, thus reducing the number of parts and increasing
the strength of the truck, a practice originated by us, on logging trucks and which is being
widely adapted by leading railroads on standard equipment.</p>

<p>This truck is designed for extreme conditions where the timber is very large and is
taken out in long lengths and where load at times will total from 40 to 60 tons.</p>

<p>From the fact that Cast Steel is substituted for structural design the expense of repair
parts is practically eliminated while the factor of safety is sufficient to meet all demands
unless cars meet with a wreck.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the method of holding the bunk in place by means of a bunk
bracket which clamps in position on the half turn. The bunk is prevented from slipping
out of position by Bunk Stops which can be seen on the side frames.</p>

<p>This truck is designed for extreme strength and rigidity. It is certain to become one
of our most popular types. Both structurally and in appearance it is a high-grade product.</p>

80,000 CAPACITY. 40 FEET LONG. WEIGHT COMPLETELY EQUIPPED 12 TONS.</h2>


<p>The efficiency of this car is a simple mathematical problem. Compare this 4-Bunk
Car with a Flat Car with four bunks of the same capacity and note the saving. The
percentage of dead weight to log capacity is 30% as compared to 36&frac14;% for the flat car or
a car cost per thousand feet logs of $78.50 as compared to $93.50 for flat car. This means
a saving of 20% on the haul back of empty cars and nearly 20% in first cost.</p>

<p>Where a large percentage of logs from 12 to 20 feet are handled, this Quadruple
Bunk car has a great advantage over any other type. The construction is such that the
entire load can be carried safely on the two center Bunks. Logs in length from 12 to 41
feet can be carried with equal facility.</p>

<p>Details are as follows:</p>

<p>Westinghouse Air Brake, Automatic Couplers, Tandem Spring Draft Rig, Two Main
Sills 10 &times; 10 in., forty feet.</p>

<p>The Bunks are arranged to dump the load on either side.</p>

<p>Two Side Sills 10 &times; 10 in. extending from Bolster to Bolster. Each Side Sill is trussed
with two 1&frac12; in. rods. Two intermediate bunks are located directly over cross ties. Bunks
are 10 feet long equipped with Knight chocks.</p>

<p>Bolsters are built up of Structural and Cast Steel of ample capacity to carry load.</p>

<p>Trucks are Standard Arch Bar type with 4&frac12; &times; 8 in. Journals. 33 inch chilled tread
double-plate, Griffin wheels. Structural Steel Bolsters and spring plank. All metal Brake
Beams inside hung.</p>

<p>This car is equipped with all necessary steps and handles and meets the requirements
of the Inter-State Commerce Commission and the U. S. safety appliance laws.</p>

<p>This car is similar in construction to the Red River Car shown on preceding page and
differs only in two important details, the first point of difference being the Bunks. These
Bunks are built up of Structural Steel and are equipped with trip stakes. The stakes are
released or tripped from the safety side of car. The other difference is that there is a
10 &times; 10 in. center sill between the two main sills which extends from draft rig to draft rig.</p>

<p>Where short length logs are handled four bunks must be provided in order to permit
of thirty and forty ton loads. This car meets these conditions perfectly. Small cars of
twenty and twenty-five ton capacity are not heavy enough for economical and careful
handling in heavy trains.</p>

<p>The same efficiency applies in the handling of logs as compared with standard flat
cars as the percentage shown on opposite page.</p>

<p>This is a Cast Steel Bunk equipped with Cast Steel Chocks held in upright position
by means of a lock together with a locking bar extending to the opposite end of Bunk. This
bar, instead of being in direct compression as is the case of other Bunks of this type, has
the compression stress reduced two thirds by means of the lock. The chock when once
tripped can not rebound into position and lock which is a frequent occurrence in certain
Bunks now on the market.</p>

<p><strong>This bunk is absolutely Fool-Proof.</strong></p>

<p>The reduction of the strain on the compression rods completely
eliminates all possibility of buckling or binding, while the positive
locking device does away completely with all danger of bad spills
from falling logs.</p>

<p>The "Rainier" Bunk is made of high grade Cast Steel and is a
picture of massive strength. It is as positive in its operation and as
simply perfect in its mechanical construction as the automatic
coupler. It facilitates and expedites the handling of logs, assuring
a saving of at least ten cents a thousand and eliminates all possibility
of danger to the operator.</p>

<p>Can be applied to any type of Logging Truck or Flat Car. Indestructible in service. No repairs.
Weight approximately 1300 lbs.</p>

<p>To unload, the grab hook is removed and the movement of the log slides chock block over end of bunk
as illustrated in figure. The chock block on opposite end is readily adjusted to the
position desired.</p>

<p>The men are never required to get on the unloading side of car. In flat car
service the cost of all wooden stakes and blocks is eliminated, a saving alone in one
year more than the cost of the Hercules Bunks.</p>

<p>Flat Cars can be unloaded in a fraction of the time, with absolutely no danger
to employees, and the strain on car body reduced to a minimum, thereby increasing
the life of the car.</p>

<p>When applied to flat cars a steel channel is substituted for the I-beam.</p>

<p>It is especially adapted for use on our Connected Trucks, and patents have
been granted covering its application to this class of car.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the Cast Steel Bolster and Bunk, with which we equip our 80,000
pounds capacity Hercules Trucks, making practically an all steel truck, and when an all
steel truck is required this is accomplished by the application
of Steel Draft Sills. This Bolster and Bunk is designed with
a great factor of safety and there is no record of a failure of
this equipment in service. The Bunks or Bolster will not
deflect, which means that there is always clearance between
the side bearings which greatly reduces the danger of derailment
on a curve.</p>

<p>This Bunk can be furnished in either 9 or 10 foot length.
The weight of this Bolster with 9 foot Bunk is 1250 pounds,
and with 10 foot Bunk is 1300 pounds.</p>

<p>This Bunk provides the desirable combination of a Cast Steel Body with a disappearing
Chock secured by a <em>Tension</em> Locking Bar. Practical experiment and engineering skill have
developed this Bunk to provide "Safety First" in handling the minimum load as prescribed
by the railways. Where an adjustable Chock is not required the "Skookum" will prove
its superiority on account of its Cast Steel Body, which is similar to our well known
Hercules Cast Steel Bunk. It has also the upward projecting flanges to prevent the shifting
of the load, and the hollow channel for the protection of the locking mechanism. This
type has been copied by designers of all modern Bunks since our first model was introduced
five years ago, and this fact is evidence of the merit of the design.</p>

<p>The offset foot of the upright leg of the Chock resting upon the sloping floor of the
Bunk makes it easily held in position but impossible to prevent its disappearing when
released. Unlocking the Chock is simple and easy and there are no sliding surfaces to wear
away. The locking bar is held by a center crank and locks on the dead center. The recess
in the heel of the Chock engages the T-head of the locking bar and makes a positive lock.
The Chock locks automatically when brought to position. The locking bar is provided with
a take-up to provide a means of overcoming trouble incident to wear or stretch of the parts,
and always maintain a perfect adjustment.</p>

Yosemite Valley Railway Standard Logging Car<br />

(60,000 POUNDS CAPACITY)<br />

Equipped with Hercules Bunks and Knight Chocks</h2>


<p>This car was specially designed for the Yosemite Valley Lumber Co. to operate on an incline 8,000 feet
long, with a maximum grade of 78%, the rise in feet from the foot of the incline to the top being 3,100
feet, the incline being in a vertical plane, but following the general slope of the mountain side and changing
from one slope to another. The cars are let down the incline by means of 1&frac12; in. wire rope, attached to a
donkey engine.</p>

<p>This car was designed to meet these conditions, and is provided with a steel backbone, reinforced at the
ends forward of bolsters to provide for the extreme angle of cable pull from a horizontal line and at the
down hill end to support the bulkhead, which is provided to keep the logs from shifting. The vertical
bulkhead posts are riveted to the steel backbone. At the cable end a special combination buffer and cable
casting of cast steel is secured to the backbone by means of gusset plates, and is also riveted to end sill.</p>

<p>The backbone is built up of steel plates and angles in the form of a box girder, of the fish belly type.
Cross bearers are located intermediate of the bolsters, and are sufficiently strong to carry the loads from the
side sills to the center construction. Experience has proved that for logging cars, steel is unsuited for use
in side sills, as continual shocks, resulting from discharging the load, cause their failure. For this reason
red fir side sills were introduced in this car, making the underframe a composite construction of steel and
timber. The side sills being supported at four points, viz.: at bolsters and cross bearers, no trouble has
been experienced from failure of these sills. In case of failure, they are readily replaced, and the work can
readily be done at any camp.</p>

<p>The bulkhead is constructed with a steel frame, with planking for the bulkhead proper, so that in case
blocking is necessary to fill out between the log and the Bulkhead, this blocking can be nailed to the bulkhead
to secure it in place, the object being to provide against the possibility of the log starting to shift.</p>

<p>The cable casting is made with a machine-fit pin to engage the shackle on the cable and place the pin in
positive shear.</p>

<p>The cars were equipped with four Hercules Bunks, to provide for short or
long logs.</p>

<p>The trucks are of the Diamond Arch Bar type, with cast steel bolsters. The
bolsters are of special design, with hemispherical center bearing, to take care of
the rock of the trucks in passing over the sharp, vertical curves.</p>

<p>Axles with 4&frac14;&times;8 in. journals, and 33 in. chilled cast iron wheels are used.</p>

<p>Cars are equipped with Westinghouse automatic air brakes and inside hung
metal brake beams.</p>

<p>The draft rig is of the twin spring type, with automatic couplers.</p>

<p>The interior of this car is arranged to accommodate halves of beef of the largest size
suspended from trolleys on a track, and have ample clearance to keep the neck of the beef
from the floor. There are three tracks extending the length of the car with switches at
the door to direct the beef to any track desired. Between the tracks at each carline are
cross hooks provided on which mutton may be hung. The tracks are arranged so that the
beef may be handled by trolley directly from the cooling room into the car and left suspended
in the car to be unloaded by trolley at destination. The economy of this specially
designed car will appeal to the packer who ships from the Abattoir to various distributing
centers. Provision is made to prevent the load from swinging which adds to the safety in
transit. Ice boxes are arranged at ends with provision for ventilation and complete
refrigeration. The thorough manner of insulation and ventilation makes it possible to
reduce the capacity of ice boxes to a minimum, thereby reducing the cost of icing and at
the same time increasing the space for loading.</p>

<p>These Portable Camps
are being introduced and installed
in nearly all large
lumbering and railroad operations
as they not only
prevent many serious losses
heretofore sustained by the
destruction by fire of camp
outfits but at the same time
make it possible to keep the
workmen's headquarters
close to the work, thereby
greatly increasing their
physical efficiency.</p>

<p>The other illustration is of a car of 60,000 pounds capacity Center Dump Ballast with
the ordinary Winding Shaft and Ratchet to operate the Doors. The special feature of this
car is the Radical Draft Gear fitted with a Standard Automatic Coupler, as the car is operated
around a curve of 35 foot radius, and the Center Bearing is a Ball-bearing mounted on
Hemispherical Center which greatly reduces Flange wear on curves. The Wheels are
Griffin "F. C. S." Street Car type Flange and Tread. The arrangement of the Hoppers is
such as to confine the Dump within the rails, which prevents waste of gravel, etc. A number
of these cars are in actual service and giving good satisfaction.</p>

<p>The prices of these cars have been made so reasonable as to place it within reach of all.

<p>This cut illustrates the underframe used in the Tank Car shown on page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, number 128.
The two main Center Sills are Steel Channel Beams with top and bottom Cover Plates.
The Recess in the center receives a Bracket which projects down from the Tank into the
Recess and prevents any movement of the Tank and obviates the necessity of blocking at
ends, which is the frequent cause of a leaky tank. This car is designed to operate on the
incline of 78% grade for the Yosemite Lumber Company, and for this reason the Dome is
located on the uphill end. The Tank is fitted with Safety Valve, and the equipment includes
Automatic Air Brakes and Couplers, Twin Spring Draft Gear, special Cast Steel Buffer
Block and Cable Casting at one end for the purpose of lowering the car down the incline.
The Cast Steel Truck Bolster is shown on page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>. The Trucks are Standard Arch Bar
Trucks with 33 inch Chilled Cast Iron Wheels.</p>

<p>This dump car is particularly adapted for use in quarries in connection with lime or
cement works, where a light easy running car is required. The body and truck frame is
unusually rigid for a small capacity car, which adds much to its life. The body of the car
is built of steel plate strongly braced with steel angles and the top rocker bearing is a steel
casting. The bottom bearing is a forged jaw with a square shank which sets into a recess
in the truck frame in such a manner that it cannot raise in dumping, but the body may be
lifted from the trucks without removing any bolts or keys. The object of this construction
is that the body will become separated from the truck in case the car is derailed and rolls
down an embankment permitting the two parts to be handled with little difficulty. The
angle of dump is ample to clear the load and the door is free to swing permitting a free
discharge of the load without bringing any shock upon the door, which in the case of the
door being held in a fixed position often causes an upset car and the consequent disabling
of the car. The door closes and locks automatically as the body is righted. The truck
frame is built of steel I-beams and channels and the drawhead is a heavy forging and fitted
with draft springs. One man may easily dump the loaded car and bring the body back
into position. The wheels are 16-inch chilled cast iron.</p>

<p>The illustrations shown herewith
are taken from actual
operations on the Lake Washington
canal. They show the
car just prior to coming in contact
with the release block,
which is located between the
rails. This block trips a lever

guide bars that automatically
tilt it to the side and raise the
corresponding side shutter allowing
the load to discharge
quickly and freely as shown
in Figure 2.</p>

<p>The car is restored to the upright

<h2><a name="Some_Facts_About_Railroad_Building" id="Some_Facts_About_Railroad_Building">Some Facts About Railroad Building</a></h2>

<h3>Curves</h3>


<p>The simplest way of designating a railroad curve is by giving the length of the radius&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>,
the distance from the center to the outside of the circle, or one-half the diameter.
The shorter the radius the sharper the curve. The length of the radius is usually stated in
feet; but English engineers often state the radius in chains (one chain = 66 feet). The
length of the radius of a railroad curve is measured to the center of the track.</p>

<p>Civil engineers designate railway curves by degrees (using the sign &deg; for degrees and
" for minutes, there being 60 minutes in one degree). The sharpness of the curve is determined
by the "degree of curve," or the number of degrees of the central angle subtended
by a chord of 100 feet. Or, in other words, let two lines start from the center of a circle
in the shape of a V, so that the angle at the point of the V is one degree (equivalent to 1/360
of a complete circle), then, if the two sides of the V are prolonged until they are 100 feet
apart, any part of a circle made by using one of these lines for its radius is a "one-degree
curve." The exact length of radius which with an angle of one degree has a chord of 100
feet is found to be 5,729.65 feet. For sake of convenience 5,730 feet is usually taken as
the radius of a one-degree curve. If the angle at the point of the V is two degrees and the
sides are prolonged until 100 feet apart, the length of each side is (almost exactly) one-half
as long as when the angle is one degree, or one-half of 5,730==2,865 feet. For a three-degree
curve the radius is one-third of 5,730; for a four-degree curve one-fourth of 5,730;
and so on. For perfect exactness the length of 100 feet should be measured not along a
straight line connecting the ends of the V, but along the line of the circle of which the sides
of the V are radii&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, the arc should be used and not the chord. The difference, however,
is so slight for any curves ordinarily used on main lines of standard gauge railroad as
to be ignored in practice. But for extremely sharp curves, such as our locomotives both
wide and narrow gauge are built for, a considerable mathematical error would be involved
by the use of 100-foot chords and calculating the length of the radius by dividing 5,730 by
the degree of curve. The ratio of this error increases with the degree of curve, since the
error is caused by neglecting the difference between the length of the chord and of the arc
(<em>e. g.</em>, a 60-degree curve and 100-foot chord mathematically compels 100-feet radius instead
of 95&frac12; feet; a 90-degree curve and 100-foot chord, 71+feet radius instead of 63.6 feet).</p>

<p>In practice, however, the formula of dividing 5,730 by the degree of curve (R==5730/D)
is almost universally used, and the mathematical error is avoided by using two 50-foot
chords for curves ranging from 10 to 16 degrees, and four 25-foot chords for curves ranging
from 17 to 30 degrees, and further sub-dividing for sharper curves, since this almost exactly
balances the error, and it is also a practical necessity in laying out sharp curves to use
short chords.</p>

<p>For extremely sharp curves, or say 100 feet radius or less, it is usual to express the
curve by feet radius rather than by degrees. The table following is computed by the
formula R==5730/D, and fractions of feet are not taken into account.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;The above engineers' method of designating the rate of curvature of a railway curve must not
be confounded with the number of degrees of a circle occupied by the curved portion of the track; thus a
curved track making a quarter turn, equivalent to a right angle, will always be 90 degrees of a circle (360
degrees&mdash;the whole circle) no matter whether the curve is an easy one with a long radius or a sharp one with
a short radius.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Rule_for_Measuring_the_Radius_of_a_Sharp_Curve" id="Rule_for_Measuring_the_Radius_of_a_Sharp_Curve">Rule for Measuring the Radius of a Sharp Curve</a></h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/fig_116.jpg" width="268" height="114" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Stretch a string, say 20 feet long, or longer if the curve is not a sharp
one, across the curve corresponding to the line from A to C in the diagram.
Then measure from B, the center of the line A C, and at right angles with
it, to the rail at D.</p>

<p>Multiply the distance A to B, or one-half the length of the string in inches, by itself;
measure the distance D to B in inches, and multiply it by itself. Add these two products
and divide the sum by twice the distance from B to D, measured exactly in inches and
fractional parts of inches. This will give the radius of the curve in inches.</p>

<p>It may be more convenient to use a straight edge instead of a string. Care must be
taken to have the ends of the string or straight edge touch the same part of the rail as is
taken in measuring the distance from the center. If the string touches the bottom of the
rail flange at each end, and the center measurement is made to the rail head, the result
will not be correct.</p>

<p>In practice it will be found best to make trials on different parts of the curve to allow
for irregularities. It is best not to measure across from one end of the curved track to the
other even when the curve is so located that this is possible, since if any portion of the
straight track at either end of the curve is included the result will be incorrect. This rule
does not apply to curves of over one-half circle if the line is drawn connecting the two ends
of the curve. It is a good plan to make the measurement on the inside of the outer rail of
the curve, as this is often more convenient. In this case one-half of the width of gauge
should be deducted from the radius when calculated, as the radius of the curve should be
measured to the center of the track.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Example</span>&mdash;Let A C be a 20-foot string; half the distance, or A B, is then 10 feet, or 120 inches. Suppose
B D is found on measurement to be 3 inches. Then 120 multiplied by 120 is 14,400, and 3 multiplied by
3 is 9; 14,400 added to 9 is 14,409, which, divided by twice 3, or 6, equals 2,401&frac12; inches, or 200 feet 1&frac12; inches,
which is the radius of the curve.</p></div>
